# Notes to Class 1 slides

* 1:
  * "like LC101" = prep work, required attendance, assignments, Mentors = TAs so rely on them
  * we'll talk about MVP later
* 2: ask me about those contextLoads I dare you
  * will share the slides later so you have the links
  * gotta talk to users to figure out what features are valuable! don't forget!
* 3:
  * your mentors will know what sounds too big, don't worry
  * CRUD = Create Read Update Delete
  * MVPs can be brutally thin! doesn't have to be pretty
* 6: rome wasn't built in a day and your app won't be either
  * use the car analogy: car got multiple parts and multiple users
  * epic == make the car, story == add the steering wheel
  * as a PERSON I want to DRIVE vs as a COMMUTER I want to HAVE AN EFFICIENT DRIVE TO WORK
  * remember MVP? Know what the Model T is?
* 7:
  * backlog == trello
