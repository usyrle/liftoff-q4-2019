# Notes to Class 1 slides

* 1:
  * hint hint: you won't do any code today
  * "like LC101" = prep work, required attendance, activities == studios, assignments
  * you'll again have mentors == TAs (but new groups!), lean on them for help
  * also "like LC101" = you're not gonna wanna fall behind (20 hrs / wk!)
  * 8 wks, break week Nov 11th, last class Dec 9th
  * we'll talk about MVP later
* 2: ask me about those contextLoads I dare you
  * also done angular, spring 5, tiny bit of react
  * big advocate for XP but it's pretty hard to teach quickly
  * will share the slides later so you have the links
  * gotta talk to users to figure out what features are valuable! don't forget!
* 3:
  * weekly updates in a 'standup' format
  * also Koko for beyond-Liftoff qs (placement, apprenticeship)
  * I'm here too for additional qs about industry and talking too much
* 4:
  * capstone is the crux of your work with LC101/Liftoff
  * your mentors will know what sounds too big, don't worry
  * CRUD = Create Read Update Delete
  * MVPs can be brutally thin! doesn't have to be pretty
  * passionate also includes tech stack! though Spring Boot is a solid choice
* 5:
  * spring boot is pretty marketable, hint hint
  * ...but you're gonna have to learn more! and on your own this time
  * can start with templates (cheese) but you're gonna have to add something
  * things that solve problems: job dbs, restaurant menu builders
  * things that don't: personal websites, video games
  * yourself == don't just copy a template, group or solo
  * we'll talk about scoping features more later - again, mentors will help
* 9:
  * waterfall looks an awful lot like how I learned project mgmt
  * it's from 1970 dude
  * agile is "hot" but don't always believe when you hear it
  * all about incremental improvement - "iterations" - want me to go back to the circle?
  * ignore the "majority of organizations" thing up top - corps tend to the left, startups to the right
  * which one sounds more fun? be honest with yourself: it's a trick question, both are good in certain respects
  * four fundamental principles: talk to your users, provide some value, TALK TO YOUR USERS, TALK TO YOUR USERS OFTEN.
* 10:
  * I was bad at all of these as a dev and I'm bad at all of them now because I'm a bad boy
  * How many times did you sit there and rerun your Spring Boot apps after making only minor changes? No changes?
  * Lots of flavors of agile: Scrum, Kanban, SAFe are a few
  * Let's talk [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) more next time
* 11: rome wasn't built in a day and your app won't be either
  * DON'T MAKE ANY ONE BLANK TOO BIG
  * as a PERSON I want to DRIVE so that I CAN GET PLACES vs as a COMMUTER I want to HAVE AN EFFICIENT CAR so that I DON'T SPEND AS MUCH MONEY ON GAS
  * use the car analogy: car's got multiple parts and multiple users
  * epic == make the car, story == add the steering wheel
  * backlog == trello and i'll be showing you some more of it in examples
  * "significant features" can be really difficult
  * what's an epic on a car?
  * what's too big an epic on a car? replace transmission - lots of steps and impacted parts
  * what's too small? put air in tires - user story
  * what's just right? body kit - take off old bumper, put on new one
* 13:
  * demo Trello
