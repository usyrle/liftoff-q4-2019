# Notes to Class 1 slides

* 1:
  * hint hint: you won't do any code today
  * "like LC101" = prep work, required attendance, activities == studios, assignments
  * you'll again have mentors == TAs (but new groups!), lean on them for help
  * also "like LC101" = you're not gonna wanna fall behind (20 hrs / wk!)
  * 8 wks, break week Nov 11th, last class Dec 9th
  * we'll talk about MVP later
* 2: ask me about those contextLoads I dare you
  * also done angular, spring 5, tiny bit of react
  * big advocate for XP but it's pretty hard to teach quickly
  * will share the slides later so you have the links
  * gotta talk to users to figure out what features are valuable! don't forget!
* 3:
  * capstone is the crux of your work with LC101/Liftoff
  * your mentors will know what sounds too big, don't worry
  * CRUD = Create Read Update Delete
  * MVPs can be brutally thin! doesn't have to be pretty
  * passionate also includes tech stack! though Spring Boot is a solid choice
* 6: rome wasn't built in a day and your app won't be either
  * use the car analogy: car got multiple parts and multiple users
  * epic == make the car, story == add the steering wheel
  * as a PERSON I want to DRIVE vs as a COMMUTER I want to HAVE AN EFFICIENT DRIVE TO WORK
  * remember MVP? Know what the Model T is?
* 7:
  * backlog == trello
