# Notes to Class 3 slides

* 0: subbing for kyle for three classes
  * lecture will get shorter + focus more on career items
  * will be plenty of in-class activites instead
* 1:
  * I'm big on short standups - lot of people to get through, and it's meant to open the door for further conversation (not the correct forum though!)
  * yes, we're using "kanban" if an interviewer asks
  * specific agile questions? terminology questions? feel free to ask now or after lecture
* 2:
  * branch visualization makes understanding WAY easier
  * think of staging + commit like saving a word doc before turning it in
* 3:
  * much of the open source community thrives on github nowadays (maybe less with MS purchase)
  * gimp vs ps and libreoffice vs office are pretty common alternatives, with featuresets rivalling the paid software
  * yes, name is unfortunate; don't get me started on LaTeX
  * other alternatives to lesser-known things: lmms, audacity, mumble
  * I totally use all of these at home
  * chrome is *free* but not *open* - chromium is *open source* but last I remember, even that's debatable
  * gitlab vs github - common model of 'open source' ver with additional features + support behind paid plans
  * gitlab is where many migrated after ms bought github
  * putty is the only choice for ssh terminal, I've yet to meet anything close
  * nothing quite like a dev with some time and a problem to hammer on - multiply by, like, the whole world and you get oss
* 4:
  * stallman is def flawed, but was fundamental to OSS as it is today
  * GNU doesn't really stand for anything, don't worry (GNU's Not Unix)
  * GNU manifesto one of the first
  * reaction to industry moving to proprietary software esp. wrt unix
  * torvalds has his *cough* flaws too - "f!@# nvidia" comes to mind
  * released the first GPL OS kernel
  * linux is de facto server choice in many use cases, and very dev-friendly
  * combination of GNU software + linus' kernel = linux, + additional proprietary bits = linux as we know it today
  * won't dive into linux flavors - you're on your own for that one!
  * okay even eric raymond is less-than-perfect, sorry
  * OSI founded after netscape started releasing source code for some products - wanted to find benefits of open software for companies
  * free software foundation activism not suitable for companies selling software
  * "open source" label less threatening to corporations, and quickly widely adopted
  * OSI basically promotes and defends the open source label + definitions
  * ballmer - "linux is a cancer" - and the halloween documents
  * remember openjdk vs oracle jdk talk in lc101?
  * oracle sued google for using java in android, and lost hard
  * also played some dumb stuff with mysql, changing the license and commercializing
  * [blackduck claims on avg 57% of codebases are open source](https://www.synopsys.com/content/dam/synopsys/sig-assets/reports/2018-ossra.pdf)
* 5: I'm definitely not a lawyer
  * copyleft = propagating license, derivatives have to be gpl
  * also strong and weak copyleft, with lesser gpl making you only release modifications to the software itself
  * MIT probably most permissive, apache only slightly less
  * CC used for non-code, and with several different flavors
  * Wikipedia uses CC-BY-SA-3.0 or 4.0!
* 8:
  * mine's not the best example, sorry
  * open source contribution looks GREAT on a resume, as does regular contribution
  * don't have to do code, try docs or styling
  * html - hyper-text MARKUP language, vs Markdown
  * would recommend linking thinks like your linkedin, offering a better professional summary
* 9:
  * my devs get more recruiter messages than I do, and I get a lot
  * yes, it's more social media, so I get it if you don't want one
  * it's basically a resume so keep it clean boys and girls - avoid things like politics, clickbait, etc.
  * add people on linked in! yes, your classmates and mentors, but also from your past positions, during your apprenticeship
  * which - you can totally find career mentors via linkedin, hint hint
  * open to job offers, also if updates show up for job changes etc.
  * has a really cute autoreply function
* 10: use the resume template!
  * template available on Canvas, look on Dec 3rd
  * LC101 and Liftoff totally belong on your resume
  * Objective statement should be a short summary of aims and what you bring to the table
  * link to your github, linkedin, and capstone!
  * more than maybe two pages, recruiters literally don't read (they get SO MANY)
  * soft skills super important imo - anyone can code, not everyone can problem solve
* 14: 11th is when your first project review is; you lucked out with an extra week!
* 15: project review is a drop deadline
