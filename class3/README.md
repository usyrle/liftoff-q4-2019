# Notes to Class 2 slides

* 0: subbing for kyle for three classes
* 1:
  * I'm big on short standups - lot of people to get through, and it's meant to open the door for further conversation (not the correct forum though!)
  * yes, we're using "kanban" if an interviewer asks
  * specific agile questions? terminology questions? feel free to ask now or after lecture
* 2:
  * much of the open source community thrives on github nowadays (maybe less with MS purchase)
  * gimp vs ps and libreoffice vs office are pretty common alternatives, with featuresets rivalling the paid software
  * yes, name is unfortunate; don't get me started on LaTeX
  * other alternatives to lesser-known things: lmms, audacity, mumble
  * I totally use all of these at home
  * chrome is *free* but not *open* - chromium was *open* but last I remember, even that's debatable
  * gitlab vs github - common model of 'open source' ver with additional features + support behind paid plans
  * gitlab is where many migrated after ms bought github
  * putty is the only choice for ssh terminal, I've yet to meet anything close
  * nothing quite like a dev with some time and a problem to hammer on - multiply by, like, the whole world and you get oss
  * https://alternativeto.net/
* 3:
  * stallman is def flawed, but was fundamental to OSS as it is today
  * GNU doesn't really stand for anything, don't worry (GNU's Not Unix)
  * GNU manifesto one of the first
  * reaction to industry moving to proprietary software esp. wrt unix (wait for it)
  * torvalds has his *cough* flaws too - "f!@# nvidia" comes to mind
  * released the first GPL os kernel
  * linux is de facto server choice in many use cases, and very dev-friendly
  * combination of GNU software + linus' kernel = linux, + additional proprietary bits = linux as we know it today
  * won't dive into linux flavors
  * ballmer - "linux is a cancer" - and the halloween documents
  * remember openjdk vs oracle jdk talk in lc101?
  * blackduck estimates something like 80-90% of code in 'production' today is open source
* 4: I'm definitely not a lawyer
  * copyleft = propagating license, derivatives have to be gpl
  * also strong and weak copyleft, with lesser gpl making you only release modifications to the software itself
  * MIT probably most permissive, apache only slightly less
  * CC used for non-code, and with several different flavors
  * Wikipedia uses CC-BY-SA-4.0!
