# Notes to Class 4 slides

* 0: not too long today, get to project review
* 1:
  * been a while since I've done one
  * problems often string-based, sometimes algorithms, sometimes business logic, sometimes you get mutiple!
  * many interviews are behavioral - tell us about a time etc. - but whiteboarding is very commom in software
  * comes in several forms - screen share, take home
  * variations floating around too - pivotal does a pairing interview
  * best to ask! some companies even tell you the question(s) beforehand
  * will let you loose on a peer live coding activity today
* 2:
  * basically what it says: they expect it to be hard
  * in fact - kind of expected to get stuck!
  * they want to see what questions you ask, what approaches you try, how you solve issues
  * think out loud! interviewer needs to hear your thought process
* 3:
  * this is launchcode's process, and what you'll be graded on next week
  * first, ask LOTS of questions esp if it's a business logic type thing. fish for edge cases too!
  * gotta figure out inputs/outputs for requirements, like a user story (ish)
  * super helpful to write things down if something's important!
  * next, piece out the steps you expect to do - like your user stories again
  * avoid the urge to jump into coding! you should show you can plan
  * even better, ask if the interviewer sees any issues before you move on...
  * ...into coding, where you can establish your for loops, your ifs and elses
  * personally I see 'pseudocode' and 'write syntax' as extensions of the same step
  * pseudocode is sufficient many times, but a lang-specific interview may require you to do the proper syntax
  * don't forget to talk out loud as you write your (pseudo)code! need to show your process
  * you might make mistakes, it's important to stay calm - if interviewer points something out, ask questions and talk through what you're thinking - if you notice something, point it out clearly
  * personally recommend you write down mistakes you notice yourself if they're not easy fixes, and come back
  * next, verbally step through your work, and check the edge cases you asked about earlier
  * then discuss any issues you or the interviewer found
  * also a good thing to do: talk about any future improvements you might have thought of!
* 4: I don't have solutions to these, but I will say 'hard' probably won't be one you're hit with :)
  * my whiteboarding experience was from a few interviews in college with Cerner
  * I was asked something simple(r) about strings, diff between private/protected/public in Java, and how to do a merge sort
  * palindrome: same back and forth ('racecar')
  * bubble sort: compare two at a time (a bubble), and sort - go over array till everything sorts
  * for the vending machine... think about things like:
    * what money should you accept?
    * what items do you offer?
    * how do you figure out change?
    * how do you handle cancellation?
    * how do you model the items + prices?
  * and - ASK FOR REQUIREMENTS
  * the source claims this is a senior-java-dev interview q, so really - don't worry, it's an example only!
* 6: keeping break short so we can get to project reviews
