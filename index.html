				<h2>An Introduction to Agile</h2>
				<p><small>Beware, job seeker! It's everywhere!</small></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>And: an introduction to Andy Yang</h3>
				<p><small>(no, I'm not running for president!)</small></p>
				<ul>
					<li>once Developer, now Product Manager @ Boeing</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Combines <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master">Scrum Master</a>
							and <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner">Product Owner</a></li>
					</ul>
					<li>Write user stories, prioritize features, and talk to end users</li>
					<li>Likes: Cats, sneakers, Slurpees&reg;</li>
					<li>Dislikes: scary movies, hot weather, "contextLoads" tests</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>A very (very) abbreviated history</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">First there was
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#/media/File:Waterfall_model.svg">
							waterfall...</a>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">...and now, there is
						<a href="https://d32myzxfxyl12w.cloudfront.net/assets/images/article_images/edf02cb0ab3634c4944fb286c4fcd6926c058666.png">
							agile</a>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">...
						<a href="https://images.mendix.com/wp-content/uploads/Artboard-5@2x-1-1220x700.png">
							and they look nothing alike</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="fragment">"<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">The Agile Manifesto</a>":
					we can't plan for everything, so let's make good, working software with what we know.

				<h3>Hard truths of programming</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You're bad at estimating time. (So am I.)</li>
					<li>You're bad at focusing on long, large tasks. (So am I.)</li>
					<li>You're bad at patiently waiting to see results. (So am I.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>...so what do we do?</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Why agile?</h3>
				<li>To mitigate all that bad stuff, we want to start small, make small changes, and build piece-by-piece.</li>
				<li>Multiple flavors of agile to achieve this:
					<a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum">Scrum</a> and
					<a href="https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/">Kanban</a> most common
				</li>
				<li>It's also a serious buzzword in tech! </li>
				<p><q cite="https://hackernoon.com/iterations-not-sprints-efab8032174c">Agile isn’t how fast you can
						go, it’s how fast you can turn.</q></p>

				<h3>Features and user stories</h3>
				<p><strong>As a ___ I want ___ So that ___</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Features are written as epics and distilled into user stories</li>
					<li>Epics are your 30,000 ft view; stories are how you get there</li>
					<li>Epics & stories kept in your "backlog"</li>
					<li>Is your feature "significant"?</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Let's talk Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>It doesn't have to be pretty: focus on usable + useful</li>
					<li>Cheaper to build a few important features then test the market!</li>
					<li>Meant to be iterated on - if users buy it, you need to keep selling!</li>
					<li>Needs to be scoped similar to user stories: "right-sized"</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h3>Activity: User story ideation</h3>
				<p>A car MVP?</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Again, the Model T</li>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a COMMUTER I want A MECHANICAL TRANSPORTATION OPTION so that I DON'T HAVE TO FEED
								A HORSE</small></li>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a DRIVER I want A WHEEL TO TURN MY CAR so that I HAVE AN EASY AND UNDERSTANDABLE
								WAY TO MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT</small></li>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a DRIVER I want A PEDAL THAT MAKES MY CAR MOVE so that I CAN ACCELERATE WITHOUT
								TAKING MY HANDS OFF THE TURNING WHEEL</small></li>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a DRIVER I want A MIRROR THAT REFLECTS BEHIND ME so that I CAN SEE ANY POTENTIAL
								HAZARDS BEHIND ME</small></li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h3>Activity: User story ideation</h3>
				<p>A drying machine MVP?</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Kind of a trick question: it's a clothesline!</li>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a PERSON WHO OWNS CLOTHES I want A PLACE TO PUT THEM WHERE THEY DRY so that I HAVE
							SOMEWHERE TO PUT THEM AFTER I HAVE FINISHED WASHING THEM</small></li>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a HOMEOWNER I want MY WET CLOTHES TO NOT DRIP IN THE HOUSE so that I DO NOT HAVE
							WATER DAMAGE OR MOLD OR MESS</small></li>
						<li class="fragment"><small>As a CLOTHES WASHER I want MY WET CLOTHES TO DRY QUICKLY so that I CAN WEAR THEM AGAIN
							SOON</small></li>
						<li class="fragment">Bonus! <small>As a CLOTHES OWNER I want MY CLOTHES TO DRY INSIDE THE HOUSE so that RAIN WILL
							NOT RUIN THEM and so that MY NEIGHBORS WON'T STEAL THEM</small></li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Activity: More tech-y user story ideation</h3>
				<p>Amazon: once a bookstore, now a kitchen sink store</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Feature: Shopping Cart!</li>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Feature: Persistent storage of cart</li>
						<li class="fragment">Feature: Quick link on item pages to shopping cart</li>
						<li class="fragment">Feature(s): User login, associate login with a unique cart</li>
						<li class="fragment">Feature(s): Running total of cart, estimated shipping cost</li>
						<li class="fragment">Feature(s): Checkout process, payment options</li>
					</ul>
