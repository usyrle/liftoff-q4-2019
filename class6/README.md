# Notes to Class 6 slides

* 1: main thing for today is live coding!
  * due to break week / moving assignments, we're splitting interview lecture across next two classes
  * will give you overview today so we have time for live coding, next time we'll dive into interview types
* 3: your mock interview will be behavioral
  * phone is usually fact-checking your resume
  * often with hr or recruiter, rather than actual team person
  * technical assesses what you know, but at a pass - not in too much depth!
  * a bit of poking to see how well you learn, maybe by asking how you've learned in the past
  * my own experience: "what's the diff. b/t private, public, protected in java" - expect object-oriented qs, maybe terminology
  * behavioral is what boeing does, "describe a time when"
  * basically hear you talk about how you were at other jobs
  * interested in how you'll fit with team, how you'll operate in the culture or environment
  * may be brought in for more interviews depending on their process / how many candidates they like
* 5:
  * dress based on company - suit for big corp, at least nice for startup, etc. ask the recruiter if you're unsure!
  * look up some news about the company, always a good thing to ask about
  * taking notes looks professional and helps you ask questions at the end, which also looks professional
* 6:
  * you may get asked about your 5 or 10 year plan, good to at least know!
* 8: do standup, then open time for live coding or project work
