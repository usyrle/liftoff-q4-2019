# Lecture Notes

* 0:
  * who's familiar with agile? how familiar?
* 1:
  * agile manifesto, while old(er), still holds very true for p much all flavors
  * waterfall is nice for engineering... but not nice for scope creep
  * basically: we always learn new things, so we have to adapt.
* 2:
  * scrum is the 'classic' example: sprints/iterations, estimates, the whole thing
  * kanban is the sticky note approach - you have a list of stickies, grab the 'top' one and work it till it's done
  * xp is Xtremely Popular right now - improves code quality, but not necessarily speed!
  * xp isn't really a "type" of agile, but is popular alongside agile practices
  * safe is corporate big agile; i think of it like a pyramid of scrums
  * my boeing team did mostly kanban, all XP, with some scrum practices salt-and-peppered in
  * my mc team does mostly scrum, with tests but not pairs, and in a SAFe world
* 3:
  * standup should be very quick so everyone can get to work; try it standing up!
  * raise help and hear what others are doing in case you can assist too
  * planning is a guesstimate of how long things will take to code
  * product owner determines priority of features, we just estimate how hard
  * planning lets PO know what we will deliver near future + where that puts other features
  * we're not good at guessing hours, so we need to estimate difficulty - product owner / scrum master will figure out about how many hours that translates to
  * retro should aim primarily for actions to improve next week/sprint/iteration
  * scrum defines a "sprint review" that i've never attended - it sounds like a demo to me
  * ceremonies for ceremony's sake is a waste of time - if you're not meeting the objective, review what you're doing with the ceremony
