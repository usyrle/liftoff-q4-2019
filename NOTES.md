# Lecture Notes

* 0:
  * who's familiar with agile? how familiar?
* 1:
  * agile manifesto, while old(er), still holds very true for p much all flavors
  * waterfall is nice for engineering... but not nice for scope creep
  * basically: we always learn new things, so we have to adapt.
* 2:
  * scrum is the 'classic' example: sprints/iterations, estimates, the whole thing
  * kanban is the sticky note approach - you have a list of stickies, grab the 'top' one and work it till it's done
  * xp is Xtremely Popular right now - improves code quality, but not necessarily speed!
  * xp isn't really a "type" of agile, but is popular alongside agile practices
  * safe is corporate big agile; i think of it like a pyramid of scrums
  * my boeing team did mostly kanban, all XP, with some scrum practices salt-and-peppered in
  * my mc team does mostly scrum, with tests but not pairs, and in a SAFe world
* 3:
  * standup should be very quick so everyone can get to work; try it standing up!
  * raise help and hear what others are doing in case you can assist too
  * planning is a guesstimate of how long things will take to code
  * product owner determines priority of features, we just estimate how hard
  * planning lets PO know what we will deliver near future + where that puts other features
  * we're not good at guessing hours, so we need to estimate difficulty - product owner / scrum master will figure out about how many hours that translates to
  * retro should aim primarily for actions to improve next week/sprint/iteration
  * scrum defines a "sprint review" that i've never attended - it sounds like a demo to me
  * ceremonies for ceremony's sake is a waste of time - if you're not meeting the objective, review what you're doing with the ceremony
* 4:
  * if acceptance criteria is lacking, say something! hard to develop to vague requirements
  * good ol' user story format is great for framing at a high level, but...
  * ...given/when/then a lot better for coding, translate nicely into tests (on purpose!)
  * bdd can be thought of as feature-level or story-level tdd: tests all the way down improve quality
* 5:
  * even i'm guilty of this; sometimes i miss a detail in the story, so i make sure to skim initially, re-skim while implementing, and read carefully before turn-in
  * context switching is absolutely killer to productivity. how many times have you gotten distracted by a bug, worked on it for a bit, then totally lost what you were working on before?
  * this extends to a higher level too: try to only have one story in work, even if your team isn't kanban-strict on work-in-flight.
  * it's also a good excuse to skip meetings that should have been emails, since that's time away from coding!
  * agile thrives on well-functioning teams; make sure you discuss changes and bring up blockers.
  * don't be afraid to speak up if you get stuck! it's scary, but it's important to maintaining velocity
  * you're all working on the same codebase, quality code helps your teammates too. so they should help you get there!
  * make sure to pipe up during retro if there's something you struggled with, and brainstorm ideas with the team.
  * no way to fix it if issue isn't raised - and agile wants you to keep improving!
* 6:
  * "fake agile" refers to things paying lip service to agile, while still mandating waterfall things
  * this includes things like hard delivery dates, detailed schedules, recurring sprint scope creep, lack of user feedback / communication
  * lots of reasons this could be, but little to be done: often comes from a high level
  * user interaction is the best thing you can do for your product: ask the actual people using it, not some person standing between!
  * work with your scrum master on time, they should usually be one of the people maintaining this
  * use things like "parking lot" or "offline" meetings to redirect things that clearly need more discussion - they shouldn't pollute things like standup or retro, since it wastes time for anyone not involved!
  * management often wants everything + the kitchen sink done before delivery - which is counter to agile!
  * see if you can deliver pieces, and deliver those more frequently
