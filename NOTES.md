# Lecture Notes

* 1:
  * scrum master and product owner are 'scrum' terms, not going to spend too much time on it now
  * yes I've been a dev too, and I miss it
* 2:
  * waterfall looks an awful lot like how I learned project mgmt
  * it's from 1970 dude
  * agile is "hot" but don't always believe when you hear it
  * all about incremental improvement - "iterations" - want me to go back to the circle?
  * ignore the "majority of organizations" thing up top - corps tend to the left, startups to the right
  * which one sounds more fun? be honest with yourself: it's a trick question, both are good in certain respects
  * four fundamental principles: talk to your users, provide some value, TALK TO YOUR USERS, TALK TO YOUR USERS OFTEN.
* 3:
  * sound familiar? almost like a huge capstone project?...
  * I was bad at all of these as a dev and I'm bad at all of them now because I'm a bad boy
  * How many times did you sit there and rerun your Spring Boot apps after making only minor changes? No changes?
* 4:
  * rome wasn't built in a day and your app won't be either
  * Lots of flavors of agile: Scrum, Kanban, SAFe are a few
  * also: EVERYONE is trying to be 'agile,' even if some teams only do it lip service. agile consultants exist for a reason
  * shouldn't say no to a buzzword resume builder :)
* 5:
  * DON'T MAKE ANY ONE BLANK TOO BIG
  * as a PERSON I want to DRIVE so that I CAN GET PLACES vs as a COMMUTER I want to HAVE AN EFFICIENT CAR so that I DON'T SPEND AS MUCH MONEY ON GAS
  * user stories should be "right-sized" - not necessarily bite-sized, but usually should be
  * use the car analogy: car's got multiple parts and multiple users
  * epic == build the steering, story == add the steering wheel
  * use T-shirt system: Small, Medium, Large - bigger than Large, should be separate stories
  * actionable is important for making TODOs into DONEs: "learn react" = bad, "do react tutorial" = good
  * "significant features" can be really difficult; what's an epic on a car?
  * what's too big an epic on a car? replace engine - lots of steps and impacted parts
  * what's too small? put air in tires - user story
  * what's just right? (pose to class)
* 6:
  * more car metaphors that i can't keep up with, sorry: let's start with the car MVP, Model T
  * useful to the user: drives; not useful: self-start (original model t had to be cranked!)
  * what about pedals? (it had a hand throttle, pedals were for gears) - more important that it goes
  * speedometer? (it cost extra!) gas supply? (you checked with a stick)
  * yes, the model t sounds sucky today - but that's cuz we've iterated over decades and decades
  * what bits are features to keep in an MVP? add later?
  * user signup? sure. superuser permission? maybe. persistent user sessions? wanna learn what cookies are really for?
  * dependencies also important - esp in groups! prioritize the initial deps (i.e. "install React") to do the later ones
