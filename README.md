# Agile Workshop slides

If you're here from class, welcome! This presentation is powered by [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), a neat JavaScript-based presentation framework. To view the slides, just clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser of choice (as long as it's not IE <= 9).

This deck is adapted from my Liftoff slides on the [master branch of this repository](https://github.com/usyrle/liftoff-slides/tree/master).
The aim is to deep-dive on the 'whys' of Agile practices for LaunchCode's Teaching Fellows and new Apprentices!
