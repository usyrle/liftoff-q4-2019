# Liftoff St. Louis (April 2019 CWI)

If you're here from class, welcome! This presentation is powered by [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), a neat JavaScript-based presentation framework. To view the slides, just clone the repository and open each `index.html` in your web browser of choice (as long as it's not IE <= 9).

This deck is adapted from my Liftoff slides on the [master branch of this repository](https://github.com/usyrle/liftoff-slides/tree/master).
My aim is to introduce agile concepts and practices in an hour-long guest lecture!
