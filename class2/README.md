# Notes to Class 2 slides

* 0:
  * sorry, no live demos today
  * small break in the middle, not big one
* 1:
  * scrum: invented 1990s
  * based on rugby term "scrum" or "scrummage" - restart play by huddling
  * originally a journal article, eventually utilized for software by two of the co-signers of the agile manifesto
  * well-defined roles driving empiricism - be as effective as possible now, and learn+improve as you go
  * work is committed to in two-week sprints, avoiding scope changes for sprint
  * kanban: originally a lean manufacturing process invented @ Toyota 1960s
  * meant to maintain inventory levels - make things as customers need them most
  * think of a grocery store - people buy what they need, only what they need; store stocks only what it expects people to buy in a week
  * software ver is kanban-inspired, appearing around 2010 +/- 5 (book published, but in use before)
  * in software, roles are left to team - lots of overlap with scrum in implementation
  * another carryover from Toyota: limit wip so you can focus+finish
  * anything at the top of the backlog is what's next... which means you're always in the backlog making sure the most valuable thing is next
* 2: hope you remember the user story examples from last week!
  * right-sized isn't necessarily bite-sized, but usually should be
  * use T-shirt system: Small, Medium, Large - bigger than Large, should be separate stories
  * actionable is important for making TODOs into DONEs
  * "learn react" = bad, "do react tutorial" = good
  * jayke had a suggestion on slack: make an Epics column, make a labelled Epic card, then use same color for other cards
  * standup is to help keep team up-and-up on everyone: mentor for individual proj, teammates for groups
  * you can't do it all at once, so do it little by little
  * remember last week? we're bad at focusing, estimating time, waiting
* 3: remember our car user stories? let's talk a model t
  * useful to the user: drives; not useful: self-start (original model t had to be cranked!)
  * what about pedals? (it had a hand throttle, pedals were for gears) - more important that it goes
  * speedometer? (it had an 'ammeter') gas supply? (you checked with a stick)
  * yes, the model t sounds sucky today - but that's cuz we've iterated over decades and decades
  * MVPs are meant to be iterated upon! Gary's app had 7-8 features, but coming out of Liftoff it only had the 3-5
  * difficulty of implementation needs to be measured vs value
  * user signup? sure. superuser permission? maybe. persistent user sessions? wanna learn what cookies are really for?
  * dependencies also important - esp in groups! prioritize the initial deps (i.e. "install React") to do the later ones
  * build 'tracks of work' on your dep chains, so you do all the stuff at once - or one dev in your group does all the stuff in a chain
  * remember: 3-5 features for your capstone - 'aggressive' prioritization means you cut off the less-valuable features (epics), and you cut out stories that don't meet the valuable features!
* groups
  * MAKE STANDUP SHORT
