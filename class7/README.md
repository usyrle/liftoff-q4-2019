# Notes to Class 7 slides

* 0: main thing for today is mock interviews!
* 2:
  * mock interview today
  * if you haven't finished live coding make sure to grab your mentor (or me, or koko)
  * project review 2 due next week, demo your MVP!
* 3:
  * might be more vague than this, but this is what I've run into in the past
  * does everyone know what each of these is really asking?
  * can you think of specific examples? that's the goal
  * lots of examples to practice with, just google around!
* 4:
  * lc process is claim + evidence, and honestly just about any strategy boils down to this
  * prep work mentions STAR, which is what I use
  * (my senior manager told me to, and it worked!)
  * mnemonic is pretty self explanatory
    * (shoutout whoever helped me remember that word last class)
  * SITUATION: equivalent to beginning of evidence - give a specific example that illustrates the claim
  * TARGET: what was the goal in the example? what were you / your team trying to achieve, fix, solve, etc. make sure goal is clear!
  * ACTION: what did you do to help reach the goal? or, what was your specific contribution on the team?
  * RESULT: the one everyone forgets about! make 100% sure to explain the outcome
  * pretty easy to talk about ACTION for a while, but you need to close the evidence and back up the claim. RESULT does that, it confirms it to the interviewer
